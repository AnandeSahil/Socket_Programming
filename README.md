# Socket_Programming
It includes socket programming (C language) between a single server and multiple clients using POSIX threads. The client has the option to upload and download files to and from the server respectively.



Please execute the serv_storage_bash.sh and client_storage.sh in the Desktop path because the program is written to serve file transfer in the folders located on the Desktop.
Use validation_script to implement the program

1. Run serv_storage_bash.sh and client_storage.sh. Will create 2 folders (server_storage and client_storage) of 100 files each.
2. Create object file for both TigerS.c and TigerC.c with the name TigerS and TigerC respectively
3. Execute ./TigerS 
4. Execute ./validation_script.sh
